# Probability of Manufacturing Defects

This Java program calculates binomial probabilities to determine the likelihood of defects in a batch of 100 circuit boards, assuming a 1% defect rate. It computes the probability of finding exactly 0, 1, or 2 defects using the binomial probability formula, and then derives the probability of encountering 3 or more defects by subtracting the sum of the previous probabilities from 1.

The program prints the individual probabilities and provides a concise summary that explains the meaning of each result. This is a practical application of probability theory in quality control, commonly used in manufacturing and engineering contexts. The code demonstrates an understanding of discrete probability distributions and showcases how to implement binomial logic programmatically in Java.
